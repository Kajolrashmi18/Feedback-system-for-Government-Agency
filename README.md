# Feedback System for Government Agency

Government and governance are both in collaboration for the governed. Government
can be referred to as the tool for this objective,and governance can be defined as the outcome as experienced by those on the receiving end. Governance in the citizen 
framework is closely allied to government and democracy,but has a different empha-
-sis . These three concepts can be considered as different views or political entities.
While government can be referred to as the 'institutional view',Democracy as the
'legitimacy view' and governance is the 'regulatory view'. Information or data is the 
most vital asset in current world,which is prerequisite to the way we function as a society.
